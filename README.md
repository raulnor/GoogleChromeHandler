# Google Chrome Handler

googlechrome:// works on iOS but not on the Mac. So I made a helper app to fill the gap. gc:// and chrome:// are also supported.

Icon is generated by running `magick app.png -modulate 100,70,83` on Chrome's app icon.

Assuming you have a swift compiler, `make && make install` should do the right thing.
